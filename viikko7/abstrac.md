I've read http://www.leanprimer.com/downloads/lean_primer.pdf

The "book" starts by questioning the accepted understanding of productivity with an analogy of relay racing. Most of the time, runners do not actually run. Similarly, we should accept that in software development (although lean thinking applies to many domains) not everyone is coding at the same time, and ther'es perhaps better ways to measure productivity. 
Next, the book defines lean by going over what lean isn't. For instance, the kanban board or flow cells are not essential to lean, but workers making improvements in their own work is. It's also not entirely about removing waste. 
The two pillars of lean are actually Continuous Improvement (kaizen) and Respect for People. There's also an elaborate visual graphic of the lean in the form of a house. 

The book mentions interviews with people at different levels in Toyota. The culture in the company is somewhat perfectionist in that firstly, new employees educate themselves for a few months before starting work and are told to think for themselves. And secondly, managers are encouraged to often visit the workplaces of their subordinates and mentor them. People are apparently educated in lean thinking through courses, and they refer to lean as a philosophy and coach others in it.

Avoiding waste in lean thinking also means focusing on the waste near the bottlenecks, not just anywhere. 

Personally I didn't like the book. So many things in it were superfluous, obvious, or a stretch of imagination. The Toyota people don't have teams, they have "real teams". They focus on quality, safety, and well-being: great advice! Doesn't everyone aim for the same?

"One of the things we learned is that most new employees first go through several months of education before starting other work. (...)
 In this way, new
Toyota people…
❑ learn problem solving through hands-on improvement experiments
❑ learn to see how lean thinking applies in different domains
❑ learn kaizen mindset (continuous improvement)
❑ appreciate a core principle in Toyota called Go See and gemba"
This to me is a contradiction. "Learn problem solving by through hands on improvement experiments before starting work"? What is it exactly they're explerimenting on? 

Of course toyota was and continues to be very succesful. But how much of it is thanks to management practices (that apparently elude so many companies and are so hard to replicate elsewhere) and how much due to fixed exchange rate system that kept the japanese currency undervalued? Eventually an asset bubble occurred in the 90's and Japan has kept to negative interest rates and nowadays the Japanese still have a weak currency, distorting the price of their exports, making them cheaper than competition.
