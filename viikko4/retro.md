The links point to different retrospective techniques. There is quite many of them and they differ in duration, goals, and context, e.g. some are 25 or 120 minutes, some make the team feel better about themselves, some are meant for teams where people know each other well or for groups of stranges. 
E.g., the "Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel" technique helps the team find out what worked out lately in the project and what didn't, thus helping the team be more efficient in their work. The technique uses props such as a flip chart paper and marker to show different "sections" of the question and focus the discussion.
"Glad, Sad, Mad" can be longer. Issues, challenges, success (categories into "Glad", "Sad", and "Mad") are written down by the team after which they are shortly presented, then team votes on which ones should be discussed and the chair of the retrospective leads the talk.
